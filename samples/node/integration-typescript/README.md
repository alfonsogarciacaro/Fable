# Integration with TypeScript

This sample shows how to call Fable-compiled projects from TypeScript.

## Overview

This sample uses Fable to build a minimal "library" (`util.fs`) and call its functions from a TypeScript project (`index.ts`).  

Please note that an `util.d.ts` declaration file is needed to import the code. In the future it may be generated automatically by Fable. 

## Running the sample

Simply run

```
fable
```

to install all prerequisites, build and run the sample.
